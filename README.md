The Google Home Page project is the first Odin Project to recreate the Google.com home page.
I will be using github and the CLI for this project.
I will also be using HTML and CSS to recreate Google's home page.
I will be using the CSS Grid to arrange the layout.
This took a long time as I had difficulty getting the grid alignment correct and also spent a long time figuring out how to get the search icon in the search box!

Happy to have finished this project but felt like I hacked my way through the code to get here!
